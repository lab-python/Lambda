
What are Microservices?


What are microservices? Let’s break down the word: “micro” (extremely small) + 
service. A microservice is a small, lightweight, and isolated service that works 
independently to perform a single function within an application. What are the core 
components of a microservice?


1. Autonomous: Each component service is independent: development, deployment, 
   operation, and scaling. Services do not share code.

2. Connected via API: Each component communicates with other components via API.

3. Specialized: Each component is designed to do one thing and to do that one thing
   well, making microservices the “experts” at their service.


When we ask what microservices mean, we are talking about these individual service 
components and the approach to software development (often for the cloud) that
embraces a microservices approach.


Individual microservices could include search, payment, cart, accounts, loyalty, 
notification, and more while building an app. These microservice components allow 
developers to build applications that are flexible to change – simply swap components
– and quick to develop since services can be integrated off-the-shelf or concurrently
developed by different team members.
